; @preserveComment                     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
; @preserveComment                        Version 3, 29 June 2007
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
; @preserveComment  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
; @preserveComment  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment                             Preamble
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
; @preserveComment software and other kinds of works.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
; @preserveComment to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
; @preserveComment the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
; @preserveComment share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
; @preserveComment software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
; @preserveComment GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
; @preserveComment any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
; @preserveComment your programs, too.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
; @preserveComment price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
; @preserveComment have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
; @preserveComment them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
; @preserveComment want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
; @preserveComment free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
; @preserveComment these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
; @preserveComment certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
; @preserveComment you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
; @preserveComment gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
; @preserveComment freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
; @preserveComment or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
; @preserveComment know their rights.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
; @preserveComment (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
; @preserveComment giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
; @preserveComment that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
; @preserveComment authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
; @preserveComment changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
; @preserveComment authors of previous versions.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
; @preserveComment modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
; @preserveComment can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
; @preserveComment protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
; @preserveComment pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
; @preserveComment use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
; @preserveComment have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
; @preserveComment products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
; @preserveComment stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
; @preserveComment of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
; @preserveComment States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
; @preserveComment software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
; @preserveComment avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
; @preserveComment make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
; @preserveComment patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
; @preserveComment modification follow.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   0. Definitions.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
; @preserveComment works, such as semiconductor masks.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
; @preserveComment License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
; @preserveComment "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
; @preserveComment in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
; @preserveComment exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
; @preserveComment earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
; @preserveComment on the Program.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
; @preserveComment permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
; @preserveComment infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
; @preserveComment computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
; @preserveComment distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
; @preserveComment public, and in some countries other activities as well.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
; @preserveComment parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
; @preserveComment a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
; @preserveComment to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
; @preserveComment feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
; @preserveComment tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
; @preserveComment extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
; @preserveComment work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
; @preserveComment the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
; @preserveComment menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   1. Source Code.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
; @preserveComment for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
; @preserveComment form of a work.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
; @preserveComment standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
; @preserveComment interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
; @preserveComment is widely used among developers working in that language.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
; @preserveComment than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
; @preserveComment packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
; @preserveComment Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
; @preserveComment Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
; @preserveComment implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
; @preserveComment "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
; @preserveComment (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
; @preserveComment (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
; @preserveComment produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
; @preserveComment the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
; @preserveComment work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
; @preserveComment control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
; @preserveComment System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
; @preserveComment programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
; @preserveComment which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
; @preserveComment includes interface definition files associated with source files for
; @preserveComment the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
; @preserveComment linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
; @preserveComment such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
; @preserveComment subprograms and other parts of the work.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
; @preserveComment can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
; @preserveComment Source.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
; @preserveComment same work.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   2. Basic Permissions.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
; @preserveComment copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
; @preserveComment conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
; @preserveComment permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
; @preserveComment covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
; @preserveComment content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
; @preserveComment rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
; @preserveComment convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
; @preserveComment in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
; @preserveComment of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
; @preserveComment with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
; @preserveComment the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
; @preserveComment not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
; @preserveComment for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
; @preserveComment and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
; @preserveComment your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
; @preserveComment the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
; @preserveComment makes it unnecessary.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
; @preserveComment measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
; @preserveComment 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
; @preserveComment similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
; @preserveComment measures.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
; @preserveComment circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
; @preserveComment is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
; @preserveComment the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
; @preserveComment modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
; @preserveComment users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
; @preserveComment technological measures.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
; @preserveComment receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
; @preserveComment appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
; @preserveComment keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
; @preserveComment non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
; @preserveComment keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
; @preserveComment recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
; @preserveComment and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
; @preserveComment produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
; @preserveComment terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
; @preserveComment     it, and giving a relevant date.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
; @preserveComment     released under this License and any conditions added under section
; @preserveComment     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
; @preserveComment     "keep intact all notices".
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
; @preserveComment     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
; @preserveComment     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
; @preserveComment     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
; @preserveComment     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
; @preserveComment     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
; @preserveComment     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
; @preserveComment     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
; @preserveComment     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
; @preserveComment     work need not make them do so.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
; @preserveComment works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
; @preserveComment and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
; @preserveComment in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
; @preserveComment "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
; @preserveComment used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
; @preserveComment beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
; @preserveComment in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
; @preserveComment parts of the aggregate.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
; @preserveComment of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
; @preserveComment machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
; @preserveComment in one of these ways:
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
; @preserveComment     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
; @preserveComment     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
; @preserveComment     customarily used for software interchange.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
; @preserveComment     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
; @preserveComment     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
; @preserveComment     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
; @preserveComment     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
; @preserveComment     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
; @preserveComment     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
; @preserveComment     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
; @preserveComment     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
; @preserveComment     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
; @preserveComment     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
; @preserveComment     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
; @preserveComment     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
; @preserveComment     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
; @preserveComment     with subsection 6b.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
; @preserveComment     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
; @preserveComment     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
; @preserveComment     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
; @preserveComment     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
; @preserveComment     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
; @preserveComment     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
; @preserveComment     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
; @preserveComment     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
; @preserveComment     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
; @preserveComment     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
; @preserveComment     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
; @preserveComment     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
; @preserveComment     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
; @preserveComment     charge under subsection 6d.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
; @preserveComment from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
; @preserveComment included in conveying the object code work.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
; @preserveComment tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
; @preserveComment or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
; @preserveComment into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
; @preserveComment doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
; @preserveComment product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
; @preserveComment typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
; @preserveComment of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
; @preserveComment actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
; @preserveComment is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
; @preserveComment commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
; @preserveComment the only significant mode of use of the product.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
; @preserveComment procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
; @preserveComment and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
; @preserveComment a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
; @preserveComment suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
; @preserveComment code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
; @preserveComment modification has been made.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
; @preserveComment specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
; @preserveComment part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
; @preserveComment User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
; @preserveComment fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
; @preserveComment Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
; @preserveComment by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
; @preserveComment if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
; @preserveComment modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
; @preserveComment been installed in ROM).
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
; @preserveComment requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
; @preserveComment for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
; @preserveComment the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
; @preserveComment network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
; @preserveComment adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
; @preserveComment protocols for communication across the network.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
; @preserveComment in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
; @preserveComment documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
; @preserveComment source code form), and must require no special password or key for
; @preserveComment unpacking, reading or copying.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   7. Additional Terms.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
; @preserveComment License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
; @preserveComment Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
; @preserveComment be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
; @preserveComment that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
; @preserveComment apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
; @preserveComment under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
; @preserveComment this License without regard to the additional permissions.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
; @preserveComment remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
; @preserveComment it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
; @preserveComment removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
; @preserveComment additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
; @preserveComment for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
; @preserveComment add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
; @preserveComment that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
; @preserveComment     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
; @preserveComment     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
; @preserveComment     Notices displayed by works containing it; or
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
; @preserveComment     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
; @preserveComment     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
; @preserveComment     authors of the material; or
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
; @preserveComment     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
; @preserveComment     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
; @preserveComment     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
; @preserveComment     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
; @preserveComment     those licensors and authors.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
; @preserveComment restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
; @preserveComment received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
; @preserveComment governed by this License along with a term that is a further
; @preserveComment restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
; @preserveComment a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
; @preserveComment License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
; @preserveComment of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
; @preserveComment not survive such relicensing or conveying.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
; @preserveComment must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
; @preserveComment additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
; @preserveComment where to find the applicable terms.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
; @preserveComment form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
; @preserveComment the above requirements apply either way.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   8. Termination.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
; @preserveComment provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
; @preserveComment modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
; @preserveComment this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
; @preserveComment paragraph of section 11).
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
; @preserveComment license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
; @preserveComment provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
; @preserveComment finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
; @preserveComment holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
; @preserveComment prior to 60 days after the cessation.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
; @preserveComment reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
; @preserveComment violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
; @preserveComment received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
; @preserveComment copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
; @preserveComment your receipt of the notice.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
; @preserveComment licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
; @preserveComment this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
; @preserveComment reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
; @preserveComment material under section 10.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
; @preserveComment run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
; @preserveComment occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
; @preserveComment to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
; @preserveComment nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
; @preserveComment modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
; @preserveComment not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
; @preserveComment covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
; @preserveComment receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
; @preserveComment propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
; @preserveComment for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
; @preserveComment organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
; @preserveComment organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
; @preserveComment work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
; @preserveComment transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
; @preserveComment licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
; @preserveComment give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
; @preserveComment Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
; @preserveComment the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
; @preserveComment rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
; @preserveComment not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
; @preserveComment rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
; @preserveComment (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
; @preserveComment any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
; @preserveComment sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   11. Patents.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
; @preserveComment License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
; @preserveComment work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
; @preserveComment owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
; @preserveComment hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
; @preserveComment by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
; @preserveComment but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
; @preserveComment consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
; @preserveComment purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
; @preserveComment patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
; @preserveComment this License.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
; @preserveComment patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
; @preserveComment make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
; @preserveComment propagate the contents of its contributor version.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
; @preserveComment agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
; @preserveComment (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
; @preserveComment sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
; @preserveComment party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
; @preserveComment patent against the party.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
; @preserveComment and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
; @preserveComment to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
; @preserveComment publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
; @preserveComment then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
; @preserveComment available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
; @preserveComment patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
; @preserveComment consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
; @preserveComment license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
; @preserveComment actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
; @preserveComment covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
; @preserveComment in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
; @preserveComment country that you have reason to believe are valid.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
; @preserveComment arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
; @preserveComment covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
; @preserveComment receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
; @preserveComment or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
; @preserveComment you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
; @preserveComment work and works based on it.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
; @preserveComment the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
; @preserveComment conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
; @preserveComment specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
; @preserveComment work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
; @preserveComment in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
; @preserveComment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
; @preserveComment the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
; @preserveComment parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
; @preserveComment patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
; @preserveComment conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
; @preserveComment for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
; @preserveComment contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
; @preserveComment or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
; @preserveComment any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
; @preserveComment otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
; @preserveComment otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
; @preserveComment excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
; @preserveComment covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
; @preserveComment License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
; @preserveComment not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
; @preserveComment to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
; @preserveComment the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
; @preserveComment License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
; @preserveComment permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
; @preserveComment under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
; @preserveComment combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
; @preserveComment License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
; @preserveComment but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
; @preserveComment section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
; @preserveComment combination as such.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   14. Revised Versions of this License.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
; @preserveComment the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
; @preserveComment be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
; @preserveComment address new problems or concerns.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
; @preserveComment Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
; @preserveComment Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
; @preserveComment option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
; @preserveComment version or of any later version published by the Free Software
; @preserveComment Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
; @preserveComment GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
; @preserveComment by the Free Software Foundation.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
; @preserveComment versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
; @preserveComment public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
; @preserveComment to choose that version for the Program.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   Later license versions may give you additional or different
; @preserveComment permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
; @preserveComment author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
; @preserveComment later version.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
; @preserveComment APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
; @preserveComment HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
; @preserveComment OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
; @preserveComment THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
; @preserveComment PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
; @preserveComment IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
; @preserveComment ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   16. Limitation of Liability.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
; @preserveComment WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
; @preserveComment THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
; @preserveComment GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
; @preserveComment USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
; @preserveComment DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
; @preserveComment PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
; @preserveComment EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
; @preserveComment SUCH DAMAGES.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
; @preserveComment above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
; @preserveComment reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
; @preserveComment an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
; @preserveComment Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
; @preserveComment copy of the Program in return for a fee.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
; @preserveComment possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
; @preserveComment free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
; @preserveComment to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
; @preserveComment state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
; @preserveComment the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
; @preserveComment     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
; @preserveComment     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
; @preserveComment     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
; @preserveComment     (at your option) any later version.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
; @preserveComment     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
; @preserveComment     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
; @preserveComment     GNU General Public License for more details.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
; @preserveComment     along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
; @preserveComment notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment     <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
; @preserveComment     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
; @preserveComment     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
; @preserveComment     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
; @preserveComment parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
; @preserveComment might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
; @preserveComment if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
; @preserveComment For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
; @preserveComment <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
; @preserveComment 
; @preserveComment   The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
; @preserveComment into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
; @preserveComment may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
; @preserveComment the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
; @preserveComment Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read

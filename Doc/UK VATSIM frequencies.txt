As a general rule, the frequencies in use for VATSIM ATC positions match those published for the real world.

However, sometimes the frequency published for VATSIM needs to be different. This is usually due one of the following:

- A frequency conflict with another VATSIM ATC position
- VOR frequencies used for ATIS (which are impossible to use with current pilot clients)

The following is a list of published UK VATSIM frequencies that differ from their real-world counterpart:

Guernsey ATIS           109.400, 118.900 on VATSIM (Guernsey radar freq)
Inverness ATIS          109.200, 124.700 on VATSIM (ATIS frequency shared with Inverness VOR)
Kirkwall ATIS           108.600, 119.425 (ATIS frequency shared with Kirkwall VOR)
Stapleford Radio        122.800, 122.805 on VATSIM (Radio frequency shared with UNICOM)
Stornoway ATIS          115.100, 121.600 on VATSIM (ATIS frequency shared with Stornoway VOR)
Wick ATIS               113.600, 121.625 on VATSIM (ATIS frequency shared with Wick VOR)

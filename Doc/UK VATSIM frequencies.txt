As a general rule, the frequencies in use for VATSIM ATC positions match those published for the real world.

However, sometimes the frequency published for VATSIM needs to be different. This is usually due one of the following:
- A frequency conflict with another VATSIM ATC position
- Avoiding 136.xx frequencies, because of difficulties selecting in certain simulators/pilot clients
- VOR frequencies used for ATIS (which are impossible to use with current pilot clients)
- 8.33kHz-spaced frequencies, which can't be selected in FS/pilot client

The following is a list of published UK VATSIM frequencies that differ from their real-world counterpart:

Stansted Director 136.200, 126.95 on VATSIM (former SS DIR freq)
Southend ATIS 136.055, 128.950 on VATSIM (Southend DIR freq as 136.+not available and new frequency uses 8.33kHz spacing)
Southend Tower 127.730, 126.720 on VATSIM (not 127.720 due conflict with Langen and new frequency uses 8.33kHz spacing)
Guernsey ATIS 109.400, 118.900 on VATSIM (Guernsey radar freq)
City ATIS 136.350, 118.400 on VATSIM (City TWR secondary freq)
Gatwick ATIS 136.520, 134.220 on VATSIM (Gatwick TWR secondary freq)
Inverness ATIS 109.200, 124.700 on VATSIM
Hawarden Director 130.015, 130.020 on VATSIM (8.33kHz-spaced frequency)
Oxford ATIS 136.230 (remains on old frequency 136.220 on VATSIM)
Farnborough Tower 122.780, 122.770 on VATSIM (8.33kHz-spaced frequency)
Battersea Tower 134.275, 122.900 on VATSIM (New frequency 134.275 introduced in AIRAC 2014/12. Continuing to use old frequency due to conflict with Shannon Information EISN_I_CTR 134.275.)
Warton ATIS 121.730, 121.725 on VATSIM (8.33kHz-spaced frequency)
Warton Approach 129.530, 129.525 on VATSIM (8.33kHz-spaced frequency)
Farnborough ATIS 128.405, 128.400 on VATSIM (8.33kHz-spaced frequency)
Farnborough Director 130.055, 130.050 on VATSIM (8.33kHz-spaced frequency)
Humberside ATIS 124.130, 124.125 on VATSIM (8.33kHz-spaced frequency)
Humberside Radar 119.130, 119.125 on VATSIM (8.33kHz-spaced frequency)
Leeds Bradford ATIS 118.030, 118.025 on VATSIM (8.33kHz-spaced frequency)
Leeds Bradford Tower 120.305, 120.300 on VATSIM (8.33kHz-spaced frequency)
Leeds Bradford Delivery 121.805, 121.800 on VATSIM (8.33kHz-spaced frequency)
Leeds Bradford Radar 134.580, 134.575 on VATSIM (8.33kHz-spaced frequency)
Leeds Bradford Director 125.380, 125.375 on VATSIM (8.33kHz-spaced frequency)

Withdrawn at some point in the past, now using real freq:
Bristol Radar 136.070, 124.350 on VATSIM

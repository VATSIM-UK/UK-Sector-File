As a general rule, the frequencies in use for VATSIM ATC positions match those published for the real world.

However, sometimes the frequency published for VATSIM needs to be different. This is usually due one of the following:
- A frequency conflict with another VATSIM ATC position
- VOR frequencies used for ATIS (which are impossible to use with current pilot clients)
- 8.33kHz-spaced frequencies, which can't be selected in FS/pilot client

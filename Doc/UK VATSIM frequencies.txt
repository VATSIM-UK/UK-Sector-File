As a general rule, the frequencies in use for VATSIM ATC positions match those published for the real world.

However, sometimes the frequency published for VATSIM needs to be different. This is usually due one of the following:
- A frequency conflict with another VATSIM ATC position
- Avoiding 136.xx frequencies, because of difficulties selecting in certain simulators/pilot clients
- VOR frequencies used for ATIS (which are impossible to use with current pilot clients)
- 8.33kHz-spaced frequencies, which can't be selected in FS/pilot client

The following is a list of published UK VATSIM frequencies that differ from their real-world counterpart:

Stansted Director 136.2, 126.95 on VATSIM (former SS DIR freq)
Southend Tower 127.72, 126.72 on VATSIM (due conflict with Langen)
Guernsey ATIS 109.4, 118.9 on VATSIM (Guernsey radar freq)
City ATIS 136.350, 118.4 on VATSIM (City TWR secondary freq)
Southend ATIS 136.050, 128.950 on VATSIM (Southend DIR fre)
Gatwick ATIS 136.52, 134.22 on VATSIM (Gatwick TWR secondary freq)
Inverness ATIS 109.2, 124.7 on VATSIM
Hawarden Director 130.015, 130.020 on VATSIM (8.33kHz-spaced frequency)
Oxford ATIS 136.230 (remains on old frequency 136.220 on VATSIM)

Withdrawn at some point in the past, now using real freq:
Bristol Radar 136.07, 124.35 on VATSIM

Battersea Tower 134.275, 122.900 on VATSIM. (New frequency 134.275 introduced in AIRAC 2014/12. Continuing to use old frequency due to conflict with Shannon Information EISN_I_CTR 134.275.)

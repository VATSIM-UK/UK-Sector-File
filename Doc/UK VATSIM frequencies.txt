As a general rule, the frequencies in use for VATSIM ATC positions match those published for the real world.

However, sometimes the frequency published for VATSIM needs to be different. This is usually due one of the following:

- A frequency conflict with another VATSIM ATC position
- VOR frequencies used for ATIS (which are impossible to use with current pilot clients)
- 8.33 kHz-spaced frequencies, which can't be selected in FS/pilot client

The following is a list of published UK VATSIM frequencies that differ from their real-world counterpart:

Cambridge Approach		120.965, 120.975 on VATSIM (8.33 kHz-spaced frequency - no equivalent 25 kHz channel)
Guernsey ATIS			109.400, 118.900 on VATSIM (Guernsey radar freq)
Hawarden Radar			120.055, 120.075 on VATSIM (8.33 kHz-spaced frequency - unknown conflict)
Inverness ATIS			109.200, 124.700 on VATSIM (ATIS frequency shared with Inverness VOR)
London/Luton ATIS		120.585, 120.575 on VATSIM (8.33 kHz-spaced frequency - no equivalent 25 kHz channel)
Oxford Director		125.090, 125.100 on VATSIM (8.33 kHz-spaced frequency - no equivalent 25 kHz channel)
Southend Director		128.965, 128.950 on VATSIM (8.33 kHz-spaced frequency - no equivalent 25 kHz channel)
Southend Tower			127.730, 126.725 on VATSIM (8.33 kHz-spaced frequency - not 127.720 due conflict with Langen)
St Athan Tower			122.865, 122.875 on VATSIM (8.33 kHz-spaced frequency - no equivalent 25 kHz channel)
St Athan ATIS			130.565, 130.550 on VATSIM (8.33 kHz-spaced frequency - no equivalent 25 kHz channel)
Stornoway APP/TWR/AFIS	123.500, 119.470 on VATSIM (8.33 kHz-spaced frequency)
Stornoway ATIS			115.100, 121.600 on VATSIM (ATIS frequency shared with Stornoway VOR)
Wick ATIS				113.600, 121.625 on VATSIM (ATIS frequency shared with Wick VOR)

Note: For reasons of brevity, only those frequencies with a real world 8.33 kHz channel that doesn't have an 
equivalent 25 kHz spacing channel are listed above.

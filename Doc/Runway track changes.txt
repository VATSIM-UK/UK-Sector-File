- Extended centrelines refers to those defined in the airport folders as permanent 'Geo', rather than ES generated versions.
- When runways tracks are updated at an airport that uses conventional SIDs, some of the "fixes" on those SIDs may change position - 
  they're not really defined fixes like on RNAV SIDs, but they're calculations for the FMC on sim aircraft at least to fly the SID correctly. 
  These fixes are contained in the 'Misc\FIXES_General RNAV.txt' file.

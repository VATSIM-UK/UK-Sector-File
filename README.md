# UK Sector File Project

The UK (EGTT and EGPX FIRs) Sector File project is an open source collaborative project to provide the highest quality sector file to VATSIM UK controllers.

A new sector file is released in line with each AIRAC cycle (as long as significant changes warrant such as release).

If you wish to contribute, take a look at:
- [Our general contributing guide](https://github.com/VATSIM-UK/UK-Sector-File/blob/master/.github/Contributing.md)
- [The first time contributor's guide](https://github.com/VATSIM-UK/UK-Sector-File/blob/main/.github/First%20time%20contributors'%20guide.md)
- [The Wiki](https://github.com/VATSIM-UK/UK-Sector-File/wiki) (a work in progress), which contains more in-depth information about the contents of the sector file.

**Note:** Past AIRAC amendments are stored [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-vBWgjwDAzqcThza1lIaHJDbEU).
